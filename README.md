<strong>UC Events lookup</strong>

http://www.user-login-1234.appspot.com/

A User-Register and Login system deployed in Google App Engine to view the events currently taking place at UC for the week.

This Web Service registers users and allows them to login. After getting registered, the user can lookup the events.

It fetches events' data from UC's official website using URLFetch and stores the data into Google Cloud SQL for Python.
